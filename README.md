==========

docx4j is an open source (ASLv2) library for docx/pptx/xlsx, similar in concept to Open XML SDK, but with its own particular strengths including content control databinding (with OpenDoPE enhancements),      XHTML import/export, PDF output, and MERGEFIELD processing.  This is the .NET version of docx4j.
